# exotic-css-extractor
query the DOM for exotic selector such as :hover, :before, :after in any combination to get all the CSS rules from the DOM-stylesheet, and also the effective end result, as the rule(s)'s styles parsed hence the new rules overwriting older ones... this project is first ever, original code
